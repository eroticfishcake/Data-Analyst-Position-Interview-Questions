# Junior Data Analyst Position Interview Questions

I have recently applied for a position of Junior Data Analyst at a company that shall remain nameless due to privacy reasons. 
I was presented with two tasks, that had to be done, within two days, in order to advance to the last stage of application.

## First task

You are provided with a Google spreadsheet that consists of 4 data sets, with 3 Placements, Impressions, Revenue split by days and advertisers. Since I don't want to expose the company's name, I have saved the dataset as an excel file, that you can find in this repository as *dataset.xlsx*

The main task is to **combine 4 datasets and create a summary table and a graph**. The table and the graph have to be able to dinamically update when the data source "dataset" updates daily with new data to eventually represent the whole month. Analyse results, provide insights and suggest how to optimize the process.
